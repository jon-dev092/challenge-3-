# Challenge 3 Password Generator

## JavaScript Password Generator
This website showcases newly aquired javaScript applications learned from module 3. Giving logic to new variables and arrays I was able to utalize functions, if/else statements,                              
and for loops to generate a new password given the criteria the user sets through a series of window prompts.
